# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm [Freeman](https://freemanjiang.com/)!

<!-- [<img src="https://s18955.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/github.png" width="25"/>](https://github.com/user/repository/subscription) -->

I'm currently a frontend developer at [Seeko](https://www.getseeko.com/) and diving into full stack Ethereum development while studying computer science at the University of Waterloo. In my free time, I enjoy calisthenics, rock climbing, and producing [electronic music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPoov46cB1Ae7XQzM6wM_Jw).
