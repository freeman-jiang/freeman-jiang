# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm [Freeman](https://freemanjiang.com/)!

I'm currently a frontend developer at [Seeko](https://www.getseeko.com/) and a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. Recently, I've been diving into full stack Ethereum development and I'd love to get to know you if you're actively involved in the space. In my free time, I enjoy reading, calisthenics, and producing [electronic music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPoov46cB1Ae7XQzM6wM_Jw). You can reach out to me via [email](mailto:freeman.jiang.ca@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/freemanxjiang).
