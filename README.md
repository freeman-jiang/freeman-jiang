### 1B Computer Science at University of Waterloo

I'm currently a frontend developer at [Seeko](https://www.getseeko.com/) and a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. Recently, I've been diving into full stack Ethereum development. In my free time, I enjoy reading, calisthenics, and producing [electronic music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPoov46cB1Ae7XQzM6wM_Jw).
