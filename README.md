# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm [Freeman](https://freemanjiang.com/)!

### 1B Computer Science at University of Waterloo

I'm currently a frontend developer at [Seeko](https://www.getseeko.com/) and taking a deep dive into full stack Ethereum development. My goal is to build things that create value for society. In my free time, I enjoy reading, calisthenics, and producing [electronic music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPoov46cB1Ae7XQzM6wM_Jw).
