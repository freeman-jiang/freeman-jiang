# 👋 Hey there, I'm [Freeman](https://freemanjiang.com/)!

### ☕️ 1B Computer Science at the University of Waterloo 

I'm currently a frontend developer at [Seeko](https://www.getseeko.com/) and diving into full stack Ethereum development. My goal is to build things that will impact the world and learn skills that will compound over a lifetime 🚀. In my free time, I enjoy reading, calisthenics, and producing [electronic music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPoov46cB1Ae7XQzM6wM_Jw). You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/freemanxjiang) or through [email](mailto:freeman.jiang.ca@gmail.com).
